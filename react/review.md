It's react, there's only so many thoughts to have. I like using JSX and hooks make it easy to work with.

Initially I made a custom hook for managing localStorage but felt it was overkill, though I think writing custom hooks allow React to feel really powerful.

Overall I feel that what might give React an edge over some of these other frameworks can't be captured in a single-file to-do app. Ask me to build a component library and I'll pick React. <sup>(for <sup>now)</sup></sup>
