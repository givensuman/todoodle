## Overall
It's react, there's only so many thoughts to have. I like using JSX and hooks make it easy to work with. The community is also so large that there's a premade snippet or library for basically everything you could ever need.

Overall I feel that what might give React an edge over some of these other frameworks can't be captured in a single-file to-do app. Ask me to build a component library and I'll pick React. <sup>(for <sup>now)</sup></sup>

## Documentation/Help
Didn't really look over the docs for this, but it's hard not to find the solution to your problem somewhere on the web. In fact, in other frameworks I often have to sift through React-based answers in search results.

## API
I love JSX. I do think parts of React's API are unintuitive at times, but pleasant to use.

Initially I made a custom hook for managing localStorage but felt it was overkill, though I think writing custom hooks allow React to feel really powerful.

## Thoughts
It's good. Very good, just not perfect. Its biggest advantage is the size of the community.
