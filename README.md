# todoodle
### An attempt to make a to-do list with every JavaScript framework I can

## rules
 - Each app must be made in one `.js` file (if possible)
 - No interaction with HTML unless intended by the framework
 - The only in-framework styling each framework needs to allow me to do is for the header (i.e. `style={{ ... }}`)
 - Each app needs to save and load state in `localStorage`
 - If Vite builds it, I'll use Vite. If not, if the framework has a build tool, I'll use that. Otherwise, I'll build it from scratch with Vite.
