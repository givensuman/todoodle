# todoodle
### An attempt to make a to-do list with every JavaScript framework I can

## rules
 - Each app must be made in one `.js` file (if possible)
 - No interaction with HTML unless intended by the framework
 - The only inline-styling each framework needs to allow me to do is for the header
 - Each app needs to save and load state in `localStorage`
