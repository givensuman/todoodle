It's been a little over a year now since I wrote my first line of code, and I wanted to test my progress by writing a to-do list. To make it a bit challenging I implemented authentication and tried to make it relatively full-featured.

#### Can I copy this?
If you don't mind spaghetti code I don't see why not. You'll need to configure a Firebase app with Firestore and set up a .env with its details.

#### Is this maintained?
Not really. Though I am interested in adding an actual "doodle" component to this with an HTML canvas. I would also probably try something other than Bootstrap as I wasn't really happy with it towards the end.

See you in a year!
