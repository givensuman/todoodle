## Overall
I didn't really like Angular. I'm sure it's fantastic for huge teams, and I think I understand how as an Angular developer it's easy to jump into a foreign component and figure it out. Yes, it has an insanely powerful CLI and Google-built ecosystem. I just didn't think it was fun to write. Granted, Angular is probably not the choice anyone would make for a to-do app this simple, but on a component-by-component basis I still feel that's true.


## Documentation/Help
If Vue documentation is a well-built manual that tells you what you need to know, Angular documentation is a textbook from 30 years ago that is overwhelming and foreign. Documentation is exhaustive and there are plenty of examples, it's just there's a ton of it and I didn't find beginner-friendliness to be the forefront in the writing.

## API
I get why the API is good -- it's opinionated, has discrete separation of concerns, etc. What I think it isn't is intuitive. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I felt I understood an API like Mithril's. Once I understood the core concepts every other concept seemed to stem from them naturally. With Angular? Well, if you need input modeling, you need to import `FormsModules`, then apply it to your `.module.ts`, then bind it to your input with `[(ngModel)]` which is a binding syntax I didn't see anywhere else. Compare that to Vue, which is simply `v-model="..."`. It's just needlessly complex.

## Thoughts
I see its value, and I'm sure it's powerful if you're used to it, I just think there are other frameworks doing things better (namely, Vue).
