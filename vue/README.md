## Overall
I was blown away at how much I liked writing Vue code. 

It's basically the best way of doing a framework I can think of.

## Documentation/Help
Really good documentation and a helpful community second only to React.

## API
I really, really like the new composition API. I have used Vue before and eventually stopped in favor of writing React's JSX.

Now, with Vue3, it feels like writing JSX in what is just a more lovable framework.

## Thoughts
I plan to use Vue again. It was pleasant to write, and basically took my favorite bits of the other frameworks and incorporated them.
