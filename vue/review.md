I really, really like the new composition API. I have used Vue before and eventually stopped in favor of writing React's JSX.

Now, with Vue3, it feels like writing JSX in what is just a more lovable framework. I think it's little things like being able to `v-model` an `<input />` to state and just having it work. I also learned about some new magic Vue has with `.stop` and `.enter`.
