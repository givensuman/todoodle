## Overall
The order that I made these turned out pretty interesting. Inferno seems to be meant to model React's class component system, which itself was meant to improve on Angular. I can see how this is basically a simplified Angular, and it takes the unintuitive nature of Angular and streamlines it quite a bit.

Of course, React has moved from class components and it doesn't seem like Inferno will. Yes, they have functional components, but they don't appear to be stateful. If there is a hook equivalent to `useState`, it isn't documented anywhere I can find, which leads me to...

## Documentation/Help
The docs are bafflingly sparse. Like, the equivalent of a bad README. I guess it's because it's literally meant to be the same as React, but as someone unfamiliar with React's class components, it felt like I was left in the wind.

## API
The API is good, I'd say it feels like just a less irritating Angular.

## Thoughts
I don't know why I would ever use this library again. It doesn't have a TypeScript template, it seemingly broke half my css for some reason which I had to fix in-line, there is virtually no documentation, and the API is at best stuck in the past.
