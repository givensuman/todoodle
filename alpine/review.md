## Overall - 6/10
It's Tailwind but for JavaScript, and I don't really like Tailwind. It was novel and kind of fun to work with, but I don't ever plan to use it again.

## Documentation/Help - 9/10
Docs are good, there aren't as many API complexities so things are easy to find and very well covered. I did run into issues getting localStorage working (the solution I ended up with isn't one I like) and finding help was basically a fool's errand. Also, the error messages were surprisingly unhelpful.

## API - 5/10
I think the API is pretty well done and surprisingly robust when you consider it's JavaScript in HTML, but I just don't like it. It felt kind of janky to work with and unlike some of the other frameworks, things didn't just work. I found I kept rewriting code so that Alpine liked it, where in other frameworks it's code I like that just so happens to work.
