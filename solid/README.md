# 7/10

## Overall 
Solid is pretty solid. It writes almost exactly like React, but with a few nice additions I prefer, like `<For>` components and more explicit lifetime controls like `onMount`.

Plus, it's supposedly way more performant. I think the only fault it has is it's relatively new. 

## Documentation/Help
Didn't like the documentation for Solid. I expect it to improve over time, but despite some outright UI bugs, API documentation is too brief and the examples don't cover much.

When I sought help with a reactivity issue I was facing, I found solutions that used aspects of the API I don't believe were documented at all.

## API
I don't really see any flaws with the API of Solid. The only noticeable difference from React is that state is called by a function, which I kept forgetting. Also ran into some issues with my `<For>` block not being reactive, but I'm sure it was something I did wrong. Overall, aspects of React's API that are unintuitive are fixed in Solid (see: `setInterval`).

## Thoughts
A good competitor to React. Whether or not this replaces it in my mind falls down not whether it's better, but if it's better enough to bother. Would be an 8/10 if the documentation was better.
