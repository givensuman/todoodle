## Overall - 8/10
Solid is pretty solid. It writes almost exactly like React, but with a few nice additions I prefer, like `<For>` components and more explicit lifetime controls like `onMount`.

Plus, it's supposedly way more performant. I think the only fault it has is it's relatively new. Whether or not this replaces React in my mind falls down not whether it's better, but if it's better enough to bother adapting it.

## Documentation/Help - 3/10
Didn't like the documentation for Solid. I expect it to improve over time, but despite some outright UI bugs, API documentation is too brief and the examples don't cover much.

When I sought help with a reactivity issue I was facing, I found solutions that used aspects of the API I don't believe were documented at all.

## API - 9/10
I don't really see any flaws with the API of Solid. The only noticeable difference from React is that state is called by a function, which I kept forgetting. Also ran into some issues with my `<For>` block not being reactive, but I'm sure it was something I did wrong. Overall, aspects of React's API that are unintuitive are fixed in Solid (see: `setInterval`).
