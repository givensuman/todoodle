## Overall
Mithril was surprisingly fun to use! I thought it would surely become a spaghetti pile after a few nested components, but the object syntax is not that far off from JSX in practice. 

## Documentation/Help
Pretty great docs. Every time I needed something it took about a minute to find, and left me with no questions.

## API
The API is pretty damn straightforward, and I was really surprised at how things just worked on the first try. When I wrote a bit of class-binding on an element that already has a class, I half expected it to break the first class, but it didn't. Getting localStorage to run on initialization took a couple tries in other frameworks, but here I just used the `oninit` property and it did the rest.

I think the object syntax would get pretty difficult to use in a really complex component system, however.

## Thoughts
I would totally not mind using it for reasonably small apps, and think it's a viable choice when you want to build a reactive single page app but don't want to install a framework with a million dependencies.
