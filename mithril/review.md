## Overall - 7/10
Mithril was surprisingly fun to use! I thought it would surely become a spaghetti pile after a few nested components, but the object syntax is not that far off from JSX in practice. I would totally not mind using it for reasonably small apps, and think it's a viable choice when you want to build a reactive single page app but don't want to install a framework with a million dependencies. If that's your use-case, bump this up to a 9/9.

## Documentation/Help - 9/10
Pretty great docs. Every time I needed something it took about a minute to find, and left me with no questions.

## API - 7/10
The API is pretty damn straightforward, and I was really surprised at how things just worked on the first try. When I write a bit of class-binding on an element that already has a class, I half expect it to break the first class, but it didn't. Getting localStorage to run on initialization may take a couple tries, but here it just took the `oninit` property and did the rest.

I think the object syntax would get pretty difficult to use in a really complex component system, however. If you're building a small single page app, bump this up to a 9/9.
